<p>NSM Photo Tags is an image tagging system for ExpressionEngine 2 designed to be used for tagging your photos.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>NSM Photo Tags compliments <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/matrix">Pixel &amp; Tonic&#8217;s Matrix field type</a> to let website administrators add selection regions to an image by adding Matrix rows and resizing the selection box. The position and dimensions for these selections are accessible in the custom field&#8217;s tag data pair for website designers to output the selection regions using <code>nsm_photo_tags_top</code>, <code>nsm_photo_tags_left</code>, <code>nsm_photo_tags_width</code> and <code>nsm_photo_tags_height</code> tags (prefixed with <code>nsm_photo_tags_</code> to minimise conflicts with other modules).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multiple position field types can be used in a single Matrix row to create different possibilities (eg: store a hit-box in one column and a css-based glow effect&#8217;s position in another column).</li>
<li>Co-ordinates are stored in the database as grid-position co-ordinates (we may consider providing a means to access this raw data for HTML5 Canvas applications).</li>
<li>Simple to use.</li>
<li>Infinite possibilities by mixing and matching different field-types in your Matrix custom field (eg: a Matrix row could store a title, caption, Playa link to another entry, hit-box area and then an overlay position for a neat image-swap effect).</li>
</ul>
